- use UniqueConstraint instead of unique_together
- always disable Django's automatic indexes on FKs, define them explicitly in Meta. Not all FKs require indexes.
- ensure all models have a Meta with sensible verbose names
- add translation everywhere
- prioritize aeshetics
- use uuid7's for IDs
- ensure that all time fields are postfixed with _at, for eg. updated_at, created_at
- for nullable FKs, add partial indexes where they are not null
- the ordering of models: id, datimetime fields, other, FKs
- ensure all models have a nicely formatted __str__
- don't use auto_now and auto_now_add. It's important to be explicit with dates and times.
